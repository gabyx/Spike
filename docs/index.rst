# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

Spike is a phone app, and its users are a welcoming community with the interests of its users at its heart. This document has been written by volunteers who use and love Spike in a bid to help people access the app to its potential. It does not cover very specific issues – if your problem is bespoke or unusual and not covered in this document, please search the Facebook site by typing a keyword in to the “Search” box in the group’s page. If you have an area that you think needs to be included in this document, please tag Kathy Bliss on the Facebook site with details.
Please remember that Spike is not a commercial product. It is designed, developed and managed by volunteers doing the best they can to accommodate everyone at the expense of having their free time and social lives severely affected so that they can dedicate more time helping others. The only thing they ask in return is politeness and patience. 

## Invites

* **How do I access Spike?** <br>
Spike is not available on the Apple App Store, instead you can download Spike through App Centre via an invitation you can request from the Spike website.      

Fill in the form at https://spike-app.com with an email address that you can access from your phone.  Within a few moments, you should receive an invitation email containing details of how to install the Spike app. Once you’ve received your invitation email, the installation process to follow is detailed in a wiki that can be found here.  Follow the instructions to the letter – they are fully comprehensive and everything you need to do is covered.  Common mistakes are trying to register your device (you don’t need to…) or missing the step about setting up your phone to trust spike’s certificate.

* **How long should I expect to wait for my invite?** <br>
ALL invites are sent automatically and so should be with you a few moments after your request.  If there’s nothing in your inbox, then please check your junk mail folder.  Occasionally, some email servers block the invitation email from spike before it reaches your account.  If this happens, please use a different email address that you ae able to access from your phone.  This isn’t something the Spike Team can change I’m afraid.
